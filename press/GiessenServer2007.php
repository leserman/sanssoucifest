                  On Monday evening a successful dialogue of experimental dance-films and
                  live performances could be seen at the Heli Cinema. The interdisciplinary
                  event titled &#8220;Lichtspielt&auml;nze I&#8221; was the opening act of the &#8220;TanzArt
                  ostwest&#8221;, the fifth version of this kind, under the artistic direction of
                  director Tarek Assam. All the films had already been shown at the Sans
                  Souci Festival of Dance Cinema. Members of the Giessen
                  Dance Company, as well as five additional dancers, commented on the films                  
									in thoughtful and polished choreographies.<br>
									<br>
                  The moving images on the screen were not, however, degraded to decorative scenery. The
                  individuality of the filmic work remained intact. The films were actually expanded and
                  commented on through the dances instead. An intensive brainstorm regarding the movies
                  had to have happened prior to the event, as the results were all noticeably cohesive and
                  well thought-out. The approaches to the material were all variably                  
									different. On the one hand the dance on stage corresponded with the<br>
                  persons or objects on the screen, on the other hand they seemed to work<br>
                  and gel with the rhythm of the editing, the sounds and the particular<br>
                  camera work.<br>                  <br>
                  Ana Baer oered a choreography to her own film &#8220;Silent Salvoes&#8221;. On the
                  screen we could see fragments of images, while the sounds of a storm and
                  fire were heard. The silhouette of a dancer dressed in white was discernable.
                  Dancing on stage were Julia Christeiner, Antonia Hess and Hiroshi
                  Wakamatsu, also dressed in white. The resulting eect was that of the
                  dancer on the screen having stepped down on the stage in three versions. Sometimes the
                  images were doubled, sometimes what happened on stage and on screen moved apart, 
									still, a cohesive piece of work was the result.<br>
									<br>
                  Tarek Assam chose &#8220;Aqua Madora&#8221; by Ana Baer for his choreography. In the film
                  a female dancer fought with a blanket on a couch. She was stretching, tying herself into
                  knots; sometimes her movements were abrupt and full of aggression. Parallel on stage Assam
                  let his dancers Magdalena Stoyanova and Antonia Hess fight with each other and get tangled up in
                  each others bodies. His ideas were particularly productive and creative, as
                  he didn&#8217;t just copy the actions of the dancer on the screen: some of the
                  choreography on stage actually commented on objects seen in the films.
                  Sometimes, for example, a leg, lifted up, would complete the line of the bed
                  on the screen, at other times the back and forth movements of a dancers
                  foot would mirror the rocking movements of a rocking chair. He also played creatively with the possibilities
                  of close-ups and wide shots, as the images
                  didn&#8217;t always fully inspire the live performance. It seemed as if the
                  choreographer now and then imply concentrated on parts of the frame to
                  masterfully expand them scenically on stage.
