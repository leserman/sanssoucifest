                  The television screen is black until a watery white strip traverses it horizontally, splitting the screen
                  and revealing mirror images of the same figure. One is lying on her back; the other seems suspended face
                  down over an abyss of darkness. The two figures begin to move in refracted tandem like a single panel in
                  a kaleidoscope. Gradually, the two dancers become four in a series of diagonal refractions and then return
                  to their horizontal mirrored duet. After two minutes and 45 seconds the strangely beautiful movement sequence
                  concludes and the screen returns to black.<br>
                  <br>
                  In dance, live performance and the three-dimensional body take precedence, but when audiences become more
                  familiar with the television box than they are with the box seats in the theater, new ways of envisioning
                  dance emerge. Mimi Garrard`s &quot;Omagbitse Suite,&quot; described above, is one take on a new catch phrase
                  permeating the fields of dance and filmmaking - &quot;dance for camera.&quot; A genre of work that is by
                  no means new, &quot;dance for camera&quot; implies bringing two-dimensional and three-dimensional together
                  in a medium that is much more widely accessible than the average dance performance.<br><br>
                  Boulder is home to a vibrant community of artists creating dances for camera, so it only seems fitting
                  that there be a local venue for this work. On Saturday and Sunday, the Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art
                  presents the second annual San Souci Festival of Projected Dance.<br><br>
                  The festival began in 2004 as a collaborative effort between local performance and video artist Michelle
                  Ellsworth and BMoCA artistic director Brandi Mathis. In one year`s time, San Souci moved from a small,
                  primarily invitational festival featuring mostly local artists to an event spanning two evenings and including
                  work from artists in San Francisco; New York City; London; Provo, Utah; Norway and Los Angeles.<br><br>
                  The experimental performance space at BMoCA is a fitting home for an atypical evening at the movies.<br><br>
                  &quot;
                  I think at first glance people mistake us for just simply an art museum. You know, pictures hanging on
                  the wall, that kind of thing,&quot; Mathis says. &quot;But one of the missions (of BMoCA) is to explore
                  intersections between genres, specifically visual and performing arts. I think that film, in particular
                  with this dance for camera work, is a good intersection of a performing art with a visual art.&quot;<br><br>
                  This year, each evening of the San Souci Festival begins with a full-length dance for camera work by an
                  established artist in the field. On Saturday the documentary about dancer Anna Halperin, &quot;Returning
                  Home,&quot; precedes the &quot;Short Souci&quot; program of curated dance for camera shorts by Garrard,
                  Ashley Hartka, Gaute Lid Larssen, Tara Jones, Carrie Noel, Cassandra Weston and Leslie Merrill. &quot;Returning
                  Home&quot; is a collaborative creation between director and cinematographer Andy Abrahams Wilson, Halprin
                  and visual artist Eeo Stubblefield.<br><br>
                  Sunday`s program opens with Elliott Caplan`s &quot;Steel Works.&quot; Caplan, who created dance for camera
                  projects with such legendary choreographers as Merce Cunningham, plays a large role in cultivating the
                  next generation of dance for camera artists and regularly offers workshops in choreography for the camera
                  in Boulder. Following &quot;Steel Works&quot; is a program of invited dance for camera works, primarily
                  by local artists.<br><br>
                  &quot;
                  Risking Cardboard,&quot; a piece by San Francisco-based filmmaker and choreographer Noel that is part of
                  the &quot;Short Souci&quot; program, began as a live dance work presented on the proscenium stage. It was
                  an adaptation of sorts, based on the story in a Velvet Underground song about a man who mails himself in
                  a box to his beloved.<br><br>
                  &quot;
                  I was really happy with some of the responses to it on stage, but I also just felt like it wasn`t the right
                  place,&quot; Noel says of &quot;Risking Cardboard`s&quot; staged premiere. &quot;It needed to have a setting
                  and context and real people in a sort of real situation.&quot; Noel, who currently is enrolled in the graduate
                  film studies program at San Francisco State University, felt compelled to explore the work as a dance film
                  instead.<br><br>
                  &quot;
                  I have kind of felt like modern dance especially is a little stale in the theater. I feel like the same
                  people come and watch the shows and the same people are in the shows and they`re all kind of the same thing
                  over and over and over,&quot; she says of her initial interest in dance for the camera. &quot;My choreography
                  in particular is geared toward really, really small details and gestures, and I just started realizing
                  that if I can use a camera and a lens and really highlight the little tiny details that are interesting
                  to me that I have more control over an audience.&quot;<br><br>
                  Though the field is not young, dance for camera festivals still are relatively scarce. Bringing such a
                  festival to Boulder is a treat for Mathis and Ellsworth.<br><br>
                  &quot;
                  It`s always an intention of mine to introduce Boulder audiences to things that they might not have ever
                  encountered before and would never encounter unless they visited a larger city,&quot; Mathis says. &quot;For
                  the dance community, I think it just shakes things up a little bit to have a chance to see what other people
                  in the country and around the world are working on. I think it tends to reinvigorate and inspire the local
                  community, seeing things from outside.&quot;<br><br>
