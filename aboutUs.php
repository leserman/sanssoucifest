              <h2>Beginnings</h2>
              <p>Sans Souci (meaning &quot;without concern&quot;) was conceived one fine spring day in 2003 when Michelle Ellsworth and Brandi Mathis sat  on the porch of a 1967 Marlette Mobile home in the Sans Souci Trailer Park in  Boulder Colorado musing about the pleasures of viewing and creating dances for the screen. Quickly Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art (BMoCA) and the <img src="images/daisycrunchgraphic.jpg" alt="Our daisy-eating icon" style="width:75px;height:74px;float:right;margin:13px;">University of Colorado at Boulder <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/TheatreDance/">Department of Theatre and Dance</a>, as well as artists Ana Baer and Hamel Bloom, added their support to transform mere musing into an Festival of Dance Cinema.</p>
              <p>What was first envisioned as an informal gathering of local dance video artists screening their works on a white wall in a trailer is now an international festival with submissions from all over the world.</p>

            <section id="vision">
              <h2>Vision</h2>
              <p>We envision a world where many people are aware of dance cinema and many of them appreciate and enjoy the form. And a world where artists everywhere can get paid for their work, especially the dancers.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="mission">
              <h2>Mission</h2>
              <p>Our mission is two-fold.</p>
              <ol>

                <li class="bodyText">Strive to slowly grow the festival each year with higher quality films and a larger, more satisfied audience.</li>
                <li class="bodyText">Provide a forum for the evolving conversation between dance and cinema - celebrating both and their potential to cross-pollinate.</li>
                <li class="bodyText">Show work in a professional and stress-free environment.</li>
                <li class="bodyText">Bring the work of international artists to Boulder, Colorado.</li>
