<div style="font-size:16pt;margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:6pt;">Call for Entries - Dance Cinema</div>
The Sans Souci Festival of Dance Cinema invites submissions of 1) film and video works that integrate dance and cinematography and 2) mixed-media works that include both cinema and live performance. We encourage submissions from all artists regardless of credentials and affiliations. Deadlines for submission are April 30, 2010 and May 28, 2010.<br><br>
We're interested in film and video works that integrate dance and cinematography. Shorts are preferred. Documentaries and animations will be considered. Note that we are not interested in simple recordings of dance on a proscenium stage - cinematic elements must be an integral part of the entry.<br><br>

We encourage you to submit a wide range of proposals: research papers, panels, lecture-demonstrations, roundtable discussions, and so on.<br><br>

<div style="font-size:16pt;margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:6pt;">About Sans Souci Festival of Dance Cinema</div>
Sans Souci Festival of Dance Cinema is a niche film festival specializing in dance cinema and incorporating live performance. Meaning "without concern," Sans Souci was conceived one fine spring day in 2003 when Michelle Ellsworth and Brandi Mathis sat on the porch of a 1967 Marlette Mobile home in the Sans Souci Trailer Park in Boulder Colorado USA musing about the pleasures of viewing and creating dances for the screen. With an expansive definition of dance and an appreciation for highly experimental and interdisciplinary forms, this unique festival exposes diverse audiences to a variety of film, video, and performance possibilities.
