Sans Souci, an international festival of dance cinema, screens short works that integrate dance with cinematic elements. We have an expansive definition of dance and an appreciation for highly experimental and interdisciplinary forms, including mixed-media works that incorporate live performance.

This year, for the first time, Sans Souci Festival of Dance Cinema is making two Calls for Entries. Our first Scholarly Gathering will be co-located with our 7th Annual Festival of Dance Cinema on September 10 &amp; 11, 2010 in Boulder, Colorado USA. We invite you to respond to our calls for entries.
