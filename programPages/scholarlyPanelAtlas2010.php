<a name="laban"></a><div class="titleAuthor" style="padding-top:12px;"><span class="paperTitle">A look through the Laban Lens at Nine Variations on A Dance Theme, </span>
  <a href="#cowart">Corrie Franz Cowart</a>, Muhlenberg College</div>
<div class="bodyCopy">In filmdance multiple moving components are at play: the moving body,
the moving camera and the edit.  Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) provides
a valuable tool through which to examine these distinct moving
components.  LMA helps to address the paradigm shifts these elements can
facilitate within the overall movement experience.</div>
<div class="bodyCopy">The classic short
filmdance, "Nine Variations on a Dance Theme," by Hillary Harris is an
ideal vehicle for this inquiry because Harris begins with a relatively
straightforward documentation of a single movement sequence performed by
Paul Taylor Dancer, Bette de Jong.  This dance sequence remains constant
and what changes is the camera and editing approach to the movement
event.  The opportunity to contrast the overall experience of these
variations, while being able to identify the changing cinemagraphic
tools in relation to the Laban Movement Analysis Lens of B.E.S.S. (Body,
Effort, Shape and Space), provides valuable insight into how the camera
and the edit contribute to the creation of "Energy" within a filmdance.
In this film there is an observable shift away from the actions of the
body as the primary focus, to the life and actions created by the camera
and the edit.   The issue of the dancers agency can therefore be 
addressed, and the transformation of the dancer into a 'site,' a terrain
for the moving camera to explore, can also be observed.</div>
<div class="bodyCopy">Addressing the
question of what is dancing in filmdance may change the rules of debate
surrounding the definition of filmdance.</div>

<a name="hills"></a><div class="titleAuthor"><span class="paperTitle">The Hills are Alive (with Dancing Bodies): Dance for Camera as Environmetal Activism, </span>
  <a href="#mcgauhey">Lyndia McGauhey</a>, University of Colorado at Boulder</div>
<div class="bodyCopy">Dance cinema introduces landscapes impossible to capture on the concert stage, introducing the site as an essential 
character.</div>
<div class="bodyCopy">In Queens for a Day, six dancers tumble down the remote hillsides of the Swiss Alps, engaging in an intimate 
and athletic exchange with a stunning landscape, dancing perfectly in tune with the contour of the mountainside. Directed by Pascal Magnin, 
Queens for a Day is a collaborative dance for camera, involving the choreographic talents of the dancers and the participation of the local 
villagers. Magnin sets up a democracy among all active players: the individual dancers, the hillside, the villagers, the backdrop, and even 
the cows are essential to the piece's meaning. Queens for a Day is an egalitarian piece, celebrating the holistic values of the modern 
environmental movement.</div>
<div class="bodyCopy">By introducing landscape and natural beauty as an essential part of the human experience, Magnin's work reflects 
environmentalism present in our culture, with scientific, political, and mystic significance.</div>

  <a href="#french">Joy French</a>, University of Montana</div>
<div class="bodyCopy">The birth of the cinema pulled onto the screen two iconic images: the dancing body and the moving train.</div>
<div class="bodyCopy">The Lumière Brothers' specifically defined themselves with movies such as "L'Arrivee d'un train en gare de La Ciotat" 
and "The Serpentine Dance".  After the success of these short, early films, the train and the dancing girl did not fade. Instead they found 
a longer enduring presence in American Western filmography.  As Westerns wax and wain in popular cinema trends, the strength of 
American mythical West (and the thus the train and dancing girl imagery) never fully disappears.</div>
<div class="bodyCopy">In this paper I will discuss how
the imagery of early cinema directly fed into the vernacular of Western films and how dance is uniquely featured as a cultural
centerpiece of these works.  I will then attempt to enlighten how the arena of contemporary dance-cinema might continue to directly
relate to the Western mythography and the embodiment of her-story in American cinema.  I will particularly focus on contemporary
dance piece, "Improvement Club" by Dayna Hanson.</div>

<a name="forgetting"></a><div class="titleAuthor"><span class="paperTitle">Seeing is Forgetting the Name of the Thing one Sees*, or Connoisseurship in Screendance.</span>
  <a href="#rosenberg">Douglas Rosenberg</a>, University of Wisconsin at Madison</div>
<div class="bodyCopy">Screen dance suffers from a lack of identity and by extension, the audience that attends festival screenings and the like, do so with a multiplicity of competing desires.  The screen itself is a space upon which is projected the often competing desires of the audience.  Complicating this is the way in which art-works at the intersection of dance and media are described: screendance, dance film, video dance, all terms that imply a unique relationship between distinct practices, which if correctly applied, have particulairity and specificity.</div>
<div class="bodyCopy">The festival screening model dominates the way in which screendance circulates and is received by audiences.  However festivals are not transparent, neutral disseminators of content.  They are formed with the desires of funding agencies, managers, directors and others engaged with the process of creating a venue for the audience to view screendance.</div>
<div class="bodyCopy">Behavior is learned, spectatorship is learned and the behavior of spectators is largely a phenomena of the behavior of the host institution.  In other words, one performs one's role as audience based on the set of circumstances set forth by the institution.  If the institution (for instance) promotes screendance as an extension of dance practice ie, dance on film, then the audience will self-select and patrons seeking dance as they historically understand it will attend, expecting the dance they desire on the screen at which they are looking.  Furthermore, as festivals do not generally differentiate between genres of dance or genres of screendance, the possibilities of connoisseurship in audiences is greatly diminished.</div>
<div class="bodyCopy">Connoisseurship then, the phenomena in which literacy grows through the collaborative efforts of curators, makers and finally audience members and patrons is the desired outcome of any art form.  Screendance audiences as any audiences can only react to what is offered for their consumption.</div>
<div class="bodyCopy">This paper will address how connoisseurship may be achieved through the collaborative efforts of audience, curator and institution.</div>
